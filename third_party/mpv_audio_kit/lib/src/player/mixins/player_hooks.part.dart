/// Hook setters: register / continue mpv hooks, plus the high-level
/// [Player.setSourceResolver] built on top of them. Hooks let you
/// intercept mpv's file-loading pipeline to lazily resolve a URL, inject
/// per-file HTTP headers, or redirect to a different source. For plain
/// URL resolution prefer [Player.setSourceResolver]; the raw hook API
/// below remains for headers, redirects, and custom per-load logic.
///
/// Usage pattern:
/// ```dart
/// player.registerHook(Hook.load);
/// player.stream.hook.listen((event) async {
///   if (event.hook == Hook.load) {
///     final url = await player.getRawProperty('stream-open-filename') ?? '';
///     // Optionally redirect the URL:
///     await player.setRawProperty('stream-open-filename', newUrl);
///     // Optionally set per-file HTTP headers:
///     await player.setRawProperty(
///         'file-local-options/http-header-fields', 'X-Token: abc');
///   }
///   player.continueHook(event.id); // must always be called
/// });
/// ```

  /// is complete — until then, mpv suspends the operation guarded by
  /// this hook.
  ///
  /// If [timeout] is provided, the library automatically calls

  /// stall when several events for the same hook are still active at
